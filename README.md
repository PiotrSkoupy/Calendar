# Calendar
In this project I'm creating a basic ETL process using Calendarific API to receive data about holidays around the world. 
To extract data I'm using python requests, I'm transforming it using pandas and finally it is loaded using sqlalchemy and sqlite.

Later on user can search through data using Dashboard app created using Dash module.
